In this paper, we explore the susceptibility of the Q-learning algorithm (a classical and widely used reinforcement learning method) to strategic manipulation of sophisticated opponents in games. We quantify how much a strategically sophisticated agent can exploit a naive Q-learner if she knows the opponent's Q-learning algorithm. To this end, we formulate the strategic actor's problem as a Markov decision process (with a continuum state space encompassing all possible Q-values) as if the Q-learning algorithm is the underlying dynamical system. We also present a quantization-based approximation scheme to tackle the continuum state space and analyze its performance both analytically and numerically.
