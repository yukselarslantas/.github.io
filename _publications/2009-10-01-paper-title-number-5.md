Reinforcement learning (RL) oers a promising approach for adaptable security systems, while the vulnerability of RL algorithms remain a concern. This paper investigates the vulnerability of RL (specifically independent Q-learning) algorithms used for defense in the context of stochastic security games with linear inuence networks. As a benchmark for the worst-case scenarios, we consider an advanced attacker possessing complete knowledge of the game and the defender's learning rule. Leveraging this knowledge, the attacker faces a Markov decision process (MDP) with high-dimensional continuum state space. We present a neural network-based approximation scheme to solve the MDP and show its effectiveness through extensive simulations of stochastic security games. Our work identies potential weaknesses in RL algorithms and highlights the importance of considering vulnerability assessment in developing robust RL-based security solutions.
