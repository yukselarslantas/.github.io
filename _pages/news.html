- 🎉 Our paper "Team-Fictitious Play for Reaching Team-Nash Equilibrium in Multi-team Games" has been accepted for presentation at the **[NeurIPS 2024](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2024/poster/96521)**!
- 🎉 Our paper "Strategic Control of Experience-Weighted Attraction Model in Human-AI Interactions" has been accepted for presentation at the **[5th IFAC Workshop on Cyber-Physical & Human Systems](https://ifac.papercept.net/conferences/conferences/CPHS24/program/CPHS24_ContentListWeb_1.html)**!
- 🎉 Our paper "Strategizing against Q-learners: A Control-theoretical Approach" has been accepted for publication in the **[IEEE Control Systems Letters (IEEE L-CSS)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10561617)**!
- We are excited to announce that the revised version of our preprint '[Strategizing against Q-learners: A Control-theoretical Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08906)' is now available on arXiv! The updated paper extends our original work to encompass multiplayer game settings. In this version, we generalize our approach to scenarios where N-type agents act as the state of the game while A-type agents compete with each other. You can read the revised preprint at arXiv:2403.08906.
- Our latest preprint, co-authored by me (Yüksel Arslantaş), along with Ege Yüceel and Muhammed Ömer Sayın, is now live on arXiv! The paper is titled '[Strategizing against Q-learners: A Control-theoretical Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08906)' and you can check it out at arXiv:2403.08906.
- Our latest preprint, co-authored by me (Yüksel Arslantaş), along with Ahmed Said Dönmez and Muhammed Ömer Sayın, is now live on arXiv! The paper is titled '[Team Collaboration vs Competition: New Fictitious Play Dynamics for Multi-team Zero-Sum Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02147)' and you can check it out at 	arXiv:2402.02147.
- Dr. Sayın presented our research on the "Convergence of Heterogeneous Learning Dynamics in Zero-sum Stochastic Games" at the CDC Workshop 2023 on "[Control, Game, and Learning Theory for Security and Privacy](https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/cdc2023workshop/home?authuser=0)". 
- Our latest preprint, co-authored by me (Yüksel Arslantaş), along with Ege Yüceel, Yiğit Yalın, and Muhammed Ömer Sayın, is now live on arXiv! The paper is titled '[Convergence of Heterogeneous Learning Dynamics in Zero-sum Stochastic Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00778)' and you can check it out at arXiv:2311.00778.
- Dr. Sayın delivered an invited talk titled “Convergent Heterogeneous Learning for Zero-sum Stochastic Games” at the [Annual Allerton Conference](https://allerton.csl.illinois.edu/), sharing insights from our ongoing research in the field.
