I'm Yüksel Arslantaş, currently pursuing a Master's in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Bilkent University, building on my Bachelor's foundation from the same institution. Under [Dr. Muhammed Sayın](https://gdn.bilkent.edu.tr/sayin/)'s guidance in the [Games, Decisions, and Networks Lab](https://gdn.bilkent.edu.tr/), my focus spans algorithmic game theory, control theory, and multi-agent reinforcement learning. My research aims to bridge theory and practical applications in these areas.

## 📰 News
- We are excited to announce that the revised version of our preprint '[Strategizing against Q-learners: A Control-theoretical Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08906)' is now available on arXiv! The updated paper extends our original work to encompass multiplayer game settings. In this version, we generalize our approach to scenarios where N-type agents act as the state of the game while A-type agents compete with each other. You can read the revised preprint at arXiv:2403.08906.
- Our latest preprint, co-authored by me (Yüksel Arslantaş), along with Ege Yüceel and Muhammed Ömer Sayın, is now live on arXiv! The paper is titled '[Strategizing against Q-learners: A Control-theoretical Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08906)' and you can check it out at arXiv:2403.08906.
