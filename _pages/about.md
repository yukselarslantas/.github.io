I'm Y√ºksel Arslanta≈ü, currently pursuing a Master's in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Bilkent University, building on my Bachelor's foundation from the same institution. Under [Dr. Muhammed Sayƒ±n](https://gdn.bilkent.edu.tr/sayin/)'s guidance in the [Games, Decisions, and Networks Lab](https://gdn.bilkent.edu.tr/), my focus spans algorithmic game theory, control theory, and multi-agent reinforcement learning. My research aims to bridge theory and practical applications in these areas.

## üì∞ News
- Dr. Sayƒ±n presented our research on the "Convergence of Heterogeneous Learning Dynamics in Zero-sum Stochastic Games" at the CDC Workshop 2023 on "[Control, Game, and Learning Theory for Security and Privacy](https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/cdc2023workshop/home?authuser=0)". 
- Our latest preprint, co-authored by me (Y. Arslantas), along with E. Yuceel, Y. Yalin, and M. O. Sayin, is now live on arXiv! The paper is titled '[Convergence of Heterogeneous Learning Dynamics in Zero-sum Stochastic Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00778)' and you can check it out at arXiv:2311.00778.
- Dr. Sayƒ±n delivered an invited talk titled ‚ÄúConvergent Heterogeneous Learning for Zero-sum Stochastic Games‚Äù at the [Annual Allerton Conference](https://allerton.csl.illinois.edu/), sharing insights from our ongoing research in the field.
