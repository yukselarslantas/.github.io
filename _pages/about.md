I'm Yüksel Arslantaş, currently pursuing a Master's in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Bilkent University, building on my Bachelor's foundation from the same institution. Under [Dr. Muhammed Sayın](https://gdn.bilkent.edu.tr/sayin/)'s guidance in the [Games, Decisions, and Networks Lab](https://gdn.bilkent.edu.tr/), my focus spans algorithmic game theory, control theory, and multi-agent reinforcement learning. My research aims to bridge theory and practical applications in these areas.
